## CHOWSOURCE
by [Caitlin](http://www.github.com/caitlinchai), [Brandon](http://www.github.com/beewuu), and [Linse](http://www.github.com/linsemathew)

#### Synopsis
This was the first project we completed using Rails during our 7th week on-site at Dev Bootcamp. The goals of this 3-day project were to simulate interacting with clients (role-played by instructors) to determine specifications for building an application, use Agile group processes, and build a working prototype or MVP of Chowsource a web app that would generate a restaurant's daily menu based on rated crowdsourced recipes. Registered users are able to submit recipes to be rated, while non-registered users can only browse through the daily menu and database of recipes.

#### Installation
Before running this application you will need to have:
* Ruby language – version 2.3
* Rails gem – version 5.0

Gems used in the app also include paperclip, pg_search, bcrypt, and will_paginate.
